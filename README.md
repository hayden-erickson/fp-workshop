# Functional Programming Workshop
a workshop to teach the awesomeness that is functional programming

## About the class

This course is intended to give you some handy tools you can use in your
everyday code. Functional Programming can help you reduce redundancy and
coupling making your code more declarative and stateless. Not only that, it can
help improve testability, make debugging easier, and isolate errors. It can be
a bit of a brain twister at first, but once you get the hang of it there's no
going back!


## What will I learn?

- [ ] Higher order functions
- [ ] Curried functions
- [ ] Pure functions
- [ ] Lambda Calculus (muahahaha)
- [ ] TDD with functional programming
- [ ] Declarative vs. Imperative styles
